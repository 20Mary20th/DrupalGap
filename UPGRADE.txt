This document describes how to update your mobile application from one minor
version of DrupalGap to another.

|=============|
| settings.js |
|=============|

  Whenever updating DrupalGap, be sure to make a backup of your settings.js file
  then replace it with the default.settings.js file. Then you must re-add any
  modifications you made to your settings.js file (i.e. site_path, etc).

|=====================================|
| Version Change Notes for Developers |
|=====================================|

7.x-1.3-alpha => 7.x-1.4-alpha

  Inside index.html, the use of cordova-2.x.js has been removed, as of version
  2.8 of PhoneGap, it appears they just use cordova.js for consistancy. So we
  will use that too, instead of using cordova-2.x-js

  The drupalgap.title variable has been deprecated. It has been replaced by
  drupalgap.page.title and should instead be set and retrieve by
  drupalgap_set_title() and drupalgap_get_title().

7.x-1.2-alpha => 7.x-1.3-alpha

  Any themes created prior to 7.x-1.3-alpha need to have their template_info()
  hook updated to match the new region naming convention. The regions are now
  keyed by name and will have their 'name' property automatically set. We made
  this change so regions could easily be accessed
  (e.g. drupalgap.theme.regions.header) instead of having to iterate over all
  regions looking for a specific name. See themes/easystreet3/easystreet3.js
  for example code.
  
  hook_device_online() has been renamed to hook_deviceready()
