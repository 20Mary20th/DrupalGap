| Installation |
|==============|

0. Enable the DrupalGap Module on your Drupal Site

1. Complete the PhoneGap Getting Started Guide for your Platform

   http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.7.0/guide_getting-started_index.md.html#Getting%20Started%20Guides

2. Download the latest release of DrupalGap (or clone the development snapshot)
   and extract its contents into PhoneGap's www directory so drupalgap.js is
   located here:

   www/drupalgap.js

   Download Links:
     https://github.com/signalpoint/DrupalGap/tags
     https://github.com/signalpoint/DrupalGap

   Note, the drupalgap index.html will overwrite the index.html provided
   by PhoneGap.

3. Open www/app/default.settings.js and save a copy of it as settings.js
   so the copy of it lives here: 
   
   www/app/settings.js
   
4. Specify your Drupal site path (with NO trailing slash) in settings.js,
   for example:

   'site_path':'http://www.drupalgap.org',

5. Run your new Mobile Application!

===================================

From here you'll have a great start to building a mobile application that
integrates with your Drupal website.
