====

1. Download the latest stable release of DrupalGap:

     https://www.github.com/signalpoint/DrupalGap/tags

2. Extract the downloaded DrupalGap archive into the PhoneGap www
   directory. When you are done, the drupalgap.js file will be
   located here:

     www/drupalgap.js

   Note, the DrupalGap index.html will overwrite the index.html provided
   by PhoneGap.

3. Open www/app/default.settings.js and save a copy of it as settings.js
   so the copy of it lives here: 
   
     www/app/settings.js
   
4. Specify your Drupal site path (with NO trailing slash) in settings.js,
   for example:

     'site_path':'http://www.drupalgap.org',

5. Run your new Mobile Application!

===================================

From here you'll have a great start to building a mobile application that
integrates with your Drupal website.
